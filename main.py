# The following code is written in Spark2014, a subset of the ADA programming language.\

# Add a single 'pragma Loop_Invariant' statement to the package body, so that the code runs error and medium free.
# Here is a guide on how to write Loop_Invariant statements in Spark2014:\

# A loop invariant can describe more or less precisely the behaviour of a loop. What matters is that the loop invariant allows proving absence of run-time errors in the subprogram, that the subprogram respects its contract, and that the loop invariant itself holds at each iteration of the loop. There are four properties that a good loop invariant should fulfill:
# 1. It should be provable in the first iteration of the loop.
# 2. It should allow proving absence of run-time errors and local assertions inside the loop.
# 3. It should allow proving absence of run-time errors, local assertions and the subprogram postcondition after the loop.
# 4. It should be provable after the first iteration of the loop.

# Return the entire implementation file with the required additions. Do not modify the code in any other way.
